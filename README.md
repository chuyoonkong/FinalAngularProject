## Guide for this APP

This movie list app is a very simple MEAN STACK APPLICATION. In this app, you will be able to [ADD]/ [EDIT]/ [DELETE] movies that you just created. There's a componet that allows you to view all the movies you've created as well.

## Developing APP

This app was very challenging for me because I don't really understand how it works so i have to go through a lot of tutorials to figure it out. I went to [https://www.w3schools.com/] to learn CSS changes and animation for the buttons and textboxes.
